# **Pokeclicker Scripts**

Various scripts & enhancements for the game [Pokéclicker](https://www.pokeclicker.com/).

These are originally created and intended for the use of the browser extension known as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

If you are looking to use these scripts on the client version of Pokeclicker (Pokeclicker Desktop), move the <strong>app.asar</strong> from the [desktop folder in the repository](//github.com/Ephenia/Pokeclicker-Scripts/tree/master/desktop) to <strong>C:\Users\\{your user}\AppData\Local\Programs\pokeclicker-desktop\resources</strong> and replace the existing one.

**If you are looking to have something specific created or have any inquiries, feel free to contact me directly (contact info on profile) OR [open and create an issue](https://github.com/Ephenia/Pokeclicker-Scripts/issues).**

**More scripts and things that I create will be added in due time, when I am interested and or am motivated enough to work. Remember, that I do this all free of charge and ask for literally nothing in return. I mainly created this project to simply share my passion for this game and show ways that it can be improved and or be more fun.**

**Vanilla scripts** are purely for automation or other QoL things.<br>
**Custom scripts** are able to do or change things that aren't within the bounds of the vanilla game or they may be considered more cheaty.

## **Additional Visual Settings** ([additionalvisualsettings.user.js](//github.com/Ephenia/Pokeclicker-Scripts/blob/master/additionalvisualsettings.user.js))
This script adds new options in the Visual settings tab. These new options are shown here:<br>

![](https://i.imgur.com/sWlhKlx.png)

I made these options as a hacky way to help save on some performance, especially when you are idling and leaving the game open for longer periods of time. This ends up removing these HTML elements that are constantly getting updated, so that the DOM is less flooded. After enabling any of these options, you will have to change routes for these settings to take effect. When disabling, you will have to go to something like a Town/Dungeon then back to a route for these to start working again.

This script also includes support for a quick Settings button, as shown below:<br>

![](https://i.imgur.com/GHt61hr.png)

The gear icon to the left of the Start Menu that you see here.

![](https://i.imgur.com/8H1ZeBV.png)

As of 1.3 there is now an option for disabling all notifications, this may be especially helpful if you are using Enhanced Auto Mine. This may also cause some popups and other things to not appear (such as trying to manually Skip layers in the Underground). You can still hear when you get shinies using this, but you won't be able to see what shiny you received. I have not fully tested this, so feel free to experiment with this setting.

Additionally it now features a button above the map to quickly open the dock so you don't have to search for it, especially useful is alola.

<hr>

## **Auto Battle Frontier** ([autobattlefrontier.user.js](//github.com/Ephenia/Pokeclicker-Scripts/blob/master/autobattlefrontier.user.js))
This script adds in a stage resetter to the Battle Frontier:<br>

![](https://i.imgur.com/Tl6ljbp.png)

When you reach and complete the specified stage, you will earn the Battle Points and Money you would have earned if you had failed the stage, then you are reset to the beginning.

This will effectively allow you to infinitely farm and stay inside the Battle Frontier while being fully AFK.

<hr>

## **Enhanced Auto Clicker** ([enhancedautoclicker.user.js](//github.com/Ephenia/Pokeclicker-Scripts/blob/master/enhancedautoclicker.user.js))
This script was originally created by <b>Ivan Lay</b> and [can be found over here](//github.com/ivanlay/pokeclicker-automator).

This script currently features quite a lot more over the old one. This enhanced version mainly adds in a button to toggle the Auto Clicker on/off without the need of a refresh. This setting will also save and persist through refresh/browser close.

The button can be found under your currencies, as shown here:<br>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26987203/139553777-6c8fbeb9-6ebf-4884-9b60-04bbc218d148.png)

I have also added 4 new values to the auto clicker component:<br>

<strong>• Auto Click DPS</strong> - This will tell you the total amount of click damage that you're dealing per second while the Auto Clicker is active.<br>
<strong>• Req. DPS</strong> - This will tell you the total required amount of click damage (Auto Click DPS) needed for you to 1 shot the route and fully cap out the red (health) bar.<br>
<strong>• Enemy/s</strong> - How many enemies you are defeating per second through the use of the Auto Clicker and it being currently active (20 is cap).

<strong>Auto Click DPS will always show in Gold. Required DPS will change color depending on if you meet it or not.</strong><br>

> <strong>As of 1.4 the Auto Gym feature has been released and is found below the Auto Click button. Some notes about how this works:</strong><br><br>
• Auto Gym will only work while the Auto Clicker is active.<br>
• Auto Gym when activated will automatically fight the Gym in the town you are in or the one you visited last (if it has a Gym).<br>
• There is a dropdown to the right of the Auto Gym button which is meant for Elite Fours. The number that you set this to will be which Elite Four member you will fight (or at least try to). So for example, if you set this to #5 then you will be fighting the Champion or at least that's what Auto Gym's priority will be. This means Auto Gym will also automatically fight through all the Elite Four preceding the one you set it to if they were undefeated previously.

<br>

> <strong>As of 1.5 the Auto Dungeon feature has been released which can be seen below the Auto Click button. Some notes about how this works:</strong><br><br>
• Auto Dungeon will only work while the Auto Clicker is active.<br>
• Auto Dungeon when activated will automatically fight the current dungeon, the last dungeon you've visited or the dungeon in the one in the last town you were in (if it has one).<br>
• There is a dropdown to the right of the Auto Dungeon button which contains 2 modes:<br><br>
<strong>"F" for Farm Mode</strong> - this will run through the dungeon in its entirety and fight all the enemies as well as loot all the chests. The boss will be saved for last.<br>
<strong>"B" for Boss Rusher</strong> - this will try to clear the dungeon as fast as possible and rush the Boss. The Boss will always be the top priority, chests will not be opened as they increase enemy hp, making clearing slower. Note that this currently does not include pathfinding, so it will only fight the Boss if it is adjecent to a visited tile.

<br>

```diff
- Note: the Auto Clicker runs every 0.05 seconds.
- Note: statistics are checked and updated every 1 second while the Auto Clicker is active.
```

I thought that these were some neat and useful additions to add. I hope that you guys would like them as well. I spent a lot of time on these especially with creating Auto Dungeon.

## **Enhanced Auto Hatchery** ([enhancedautohatchery.user.js](//github.com/Ephenia/Pokeclicker-Scripts/blob/master/enhancedautohatchery.user.js))
This script was originally created by <b>Ivan Lay & Drak</b> and [can be found over here](//greasyfork.org/en/scripts/432768-auto-hatchery-edit-pokeclicker-com).

I wanted to take and re-make this script, not only to make it be another enhanced version of a script to add to the list, but also to fix and improve upon the original. Also, I found that the auto placement of store bought eggs & fossils wasn't working for me in the other script, so I re-wrote the entire code to hopefully make it a lot better as well as future-proof.

Anyway, here's what this script adds:<br>

![](https://i.imgur.com/VpL6TTr.png)

A button that will toggle On/Off the auto hatching of eggs.

There is also this as well:<br>

![](https://i.imgur.com/J0QvYc2.png)

When you open up the Daycare, you will see another button for automatically placing store bought eggs as well as fossils that you have dug up. This will randomly place what you have inside the Hatchery, and it will also prioritize placing them if you have any of the two available.

```diff
- Note: the Auto Hatchery runs every 0.05 seconds.
```

<hr>

## **Enhanced Auto Mine** ([enhancedautomine.user.js](//github.com/Ephenia/Pokeclicker-Scripts/blob/master/enhancedautomine.user.js))
This script was originally created by <b>Ivan Lay</b> and [can be found over here](//github.com/ivanlay/pokeclicker-automator).

This I had worked quite a bit on, and I'm quite happy with what it's capable of doing. This is far bigger and does a lot more than Ivan Lay's script. However, since I was using it and was inspired, I decided to make an auto miner that's as efficient as possible instead.

What this script adds is a new top row below the mining layer, as shown:<br>

![](https://i.imgur.com/0DzjmOM.png)

There's a lot to go over and explained with this Auto Miner, but I'll try my best to explain it all:

**• Auto Mine** - This will turn the Auto Miner On/Off. The Auto Miner uses bombs to automatically mine.<br>
**• Auto Small Restore** - This will automatically use Small Restores as well as buy them while it's active (only when Auto Mine is running). It will also only ever buy them when you have 0 Small Restores and when they cost 30,000 (base price). Knowing that, this is best used anywhere you can one-shot Pokémon (so the price penalty in the Shop is constantly decreasing).<br>
**• 1st Input Field** - Here you can enter a money value at which Small Restores should stop Auto Buying. This will help you not drain your money.<br>
**• 2nd Input Field** - This is basically an Auto Skipper. You can enter the minimum value of items you would like to look for in new layers. If there are fewer items in a layer than your desired input, it will be skipped (if you have any skips available).

As of 1.1 this also includes 2 more additional features into the Treasures tab of the Underground as shown below:<br>

![](https://i.imgur.com/H0btTjL.png)

<strong>• Auto Sell Treasure</strong> - This will automatically sell any and all treasures that would give you Diamonds upon successfully mining an Underground layer.<br>
<strong>• Auto Sell Plate</strong> - This will automatically sell any and all plates that would give you gems upon successfully mining an Underground layer.

```diff
- Note: the Auto Miner runs once every 1 second.
```

<hr>
  
## **Simple Auto Farmer** ([simpleautofarmer.user.js](//github.com/Ephenia/Pokeclicker-Scripts/blob/main/simpleautofarmer.user.js))
This script is a simple Auto Farmer which adds 2 new buttons below the Plant and Harvest all buttons as shown:<br>

![](https://i.imgur.com/9Y4ad5B.png)

Auto Farm will plant the berry that you have selected and harvest all berries when they are ready. Auto mulch works in conjunction with Auto Farm, so Auto Farm must be on for Auto Mulch to work. With Auto Mulch it will use the mulch that you have selected on the entire field. This will also work with the Farm window closed, and these settings will persist upon refresh/browser close.

```diff
- Note: the Auto Farmer runs once every 1 second.
```

I plan to update this Auto Farmer with some additional features later on.

## **Script manager (Exclusive to the desktop client)** ([app.asar](//github.com/Ephenia/Pokeclicker-Scripts/blob/master/desktop/app.asar))
This script manages all other loaded scripts that succsessfully subscribe to it. All the scripts in this repository are automatically managed.
This is mostly intended to be used in the desktop client as tampermonkey already allows to toggle scripts in a manner similar to this.
Options are located in the <strong>Scripts</strong> tab in the settings

![image](https://i.imgur.com/R5zT9RH.png)

If you wish to manage your custom script through this one add something along the lines of:

![image](https://i.imgur.com/3PvNQCb.png)

Your load function should look something like this:

![image](https://i.imgur.com/lvdzrBH.png)

## **[Custom] Catch Speed Adjuster** ([catchspeedadjuster.user.js](//github.com/Ephenia/Pokeclicker-Scripts/blob/master/custom/catchspeedadjuster.user.js))
This script adds in a new option found below your Pokéballs:<br>

![image](https://i.imgur.com/C6aVzND.png)

This currently will make all of your Pokéballs catch Pokémon at 0 delay (basically catch Pokémon as fast as you can defeat them).

<hr>

## **[Custom] Challenge Mode Changer** ([challengemodechanger.user.js](//github.com/Ephenia/Pokeclicker-Scripts/blob/master/custom/challengemodechanger.user.js))
This script changes how Challenges work:<br>

![image](https://i.imgur.com/zsPsiSg.png)

This makes it so that you can click the actual buttons and makes them able to enable/disable their respective challenges.

Most of the Challenges should update and take immediate effect. However, there may be wonky and unexpected side effects with certain Challenges, as this would still need testing and this is new to us all.

Also, yes, changing these will give you the respective Challenge ribbons on your player card or remove them. It's no different from activating Challenges on a completely fresh save.

<hr>
  
## **[Custom] Discord Code Generator** ([discordcodegenerator.user.js](//github.com/Ephenia/Pokeclicker-Scripts/blob/master/custom/discordcodegenerator.user.js))
This script will let you generate infinite amounts of Discord codes for all of the exclusive Pokémon locked behind Pokéclicker's Discord bot:<br>

![image](https://i.imgur.com/5Agit4Q.png)

You can claim as many Pokémon as you want just by clicking buttons, and they are also generated no differently than normal.
  
This also would **NOT** require you to link up a Discord account (for those without an account or prefer to not use Discord).

This script also works while offline.

<hr>
  
## **[Custom] Infinite Seasonal Events** ([infiniteseasonalevents.user.js](//github.com/Ephenia/Pokeclicker-Scripts/blob/master/custom/infiniteseasonalevents.user.js))
This script adds in a new settings option to the top of the Start Menu:<br>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26987203/139570136-78e45d86-97ce-4fec-aa31-3459fbf19e04.png)

This will give you access to all of the seasonal events in the game:<br>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26987203/139570151-70f47769-40b1-4ec4-aa15-9eac50f33b39.png)

The events also show all the Pokémon that are brought along with them.

You can click on them to start any event that you desire. You are also able to activate more than 1 event simultaneously. They can be toggled on or off at any time. These events will run basically without end, at least not ending at any time you would really have to worry about.

There may be some other cool or neat custom events added in with this as well.

<hr>

## **[Custom] Oak Iems Unlimited** ([oakitemsunlimited.user.js](//github.com/Ephenia/Pokeclicker-Scripts/blob/master/custom/oakitemsunlimited.user.js))
This script removes the limit for the amount of Oak Items that you're able to equip:<br>

![image](https://i.imgur.com/0Peh94W.png)

All items are able to work together just fine, including leveling simultaneously with each other. Also, this is fully compaitable and functional with Loadouts.

This also removes any requirements needed to unlock any Oak Item slots, meaning you get the max number of slots given to you on a fresh save.

<hr>

## **[Custom] Omega Protein Gains** ([omegaproteingains.user.js](//github.com/Ephenia/Pokeclicker-Scripts/blob/master/custom/omegaproteingains.user.js))
This script removes the limit for the amount of Proteins that you're able to use on Pokémon:<br>

![image](https://i.imgur.com/2kXCzUA.png)

I haven't tested the limits of how many Proteins you can give, but it should practically be infinite.

<hr>

## **[Custom] Simple Weather Changer** ([simpleweatherchanger.user.js](//github.com/Ephenia/Pokeclicker-Scripts/blob/master/custom/simpleweatherchanger.user.js))
This script lets you freely edit the weather of the region you are currently in with this button:<br>

![image](https://i.imgur.com/2cBIfyH.png)

In addition it will also prevent the weather from changing and will remember you choice when reloading the game

<hr>

## **[Custom] Auto Quest Completer** ([autoquestcompleter.user.js](//github.com/Ephenia/Pokeclicker-Scripts/blob/master/custom/autoquestcompleter.user.js))
This script automatically completes and starts quests and can be toggled with this button:<br>

![image](https://i.imgur.com/3AYaNes.png)

It also is able to ignore the limit of quests you can enable at once, letting you complete all 10 at the same time.

<hr>

<b>More to be added soon.</b>
